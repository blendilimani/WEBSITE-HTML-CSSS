      <p>A university (Latin: universitas, 'one whole') is an institution of higher education (or tertiary) which grants academic degrees in several academic disciplines. Universities usually offer undergraduate and postgraduate programs.
</p>
      <br>
      <p>The word university is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars".
</p>
      <br>
      <p>The first universities were established in Europe by Catholic monks. The University of Bologna (Università di Bologna), founded in 1088, is the first university in terms of:</p>
      <br>
      <p>Being an institute for awarding high degrees;
having independence from ecclesiastical schools, though run by both clergy and non-clergy;
using the word universitas (which was created at its foundation);
issuance of secular and non-secular degrees: grammar, rhetoric, logic, theology, canon law, notarial law.</p>

 <h2>Early modern universities</h2>
      <p>During the Early Modern period (approximately late 15th century to 1800), the universities of Europe would see a tremendous amount of growth, productivity and innovative research. At the end of the Middle Ages, about 400 years after the first European university was founded, there were twenty-nine universities spread throughout Europe. In the 15th century, twenty-eight new ones were created, with another eighteen added between 1500 and 1625. This pace continued until by the end of the 18th century there were approximately 143 universities in Europe, with the highest concentrations in the German Empire , Italian countries , France , and Spain  – this was close to a 500% increase over the number of universities toward the end of the Middle Ages. This number does not include the numerous universities that disappeared, or institutions that merged with other universities during this time. The identification of a university was not necessarily obvious during the Early Modern period, as the term is applied to a burgeoning number of institutions. In fact, the term "university" was not always used to designate a higher education institution. In Mediterranean countries, the term studium generale was still often used, while "Academy" was common in Northern European countries.
</p>
      <br>
      <p>The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. 
</p>
      <br>
      <p>Although the structural model provided by the University of Paris, where student members are controlled by faculty "masters", provided a standard for universities, the application of this model took at least three different forms. There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum; this model tended to train specialists. There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at University of Oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more of a generalist nature. There were also universities that combined these models, using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization.</p>
